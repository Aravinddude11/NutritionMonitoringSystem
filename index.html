          <h3>BMI introduction</h2>
          <p>BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a measure used to determine whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height by calculating their tissue mass. This value helps categorize individuals as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. Although BMI is not a perfect measure, it serves as a useful indicator for assessing potential health risks and the need for further evaluation. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that are used by the calculator.</p>
          
          <h3>BMI Classification for Adults</h3>
          <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) provides recommended BMI values to determine body weight for adults. These guidelines apply to both men and women aged 20 and above.</p>

          <h3>Risks associated with being overweight</h3>
          <p>Being overweight increases the risk of a number of serious diseases and health conditions. Below is a list of said risks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>High blood pressure</li>
            <li>Type II diabetes</li>
            <li>Coronary heart disease</li>
            <li>Sleep apnea and breathing problems</li>
            <li>Certain cancers (endometrial, breast, colon, kidney, gallbladder, liver)</li>
            <li>Low quality of life</li>
            <li>Mental illnesses such as clinical depression, anxiety, and others</li>
            <li>Generally, an increased risk of mortality compared to those with a healthy BMI</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As can be seen from the list above, there are numerous negative, in some cases fatal, outcomes that may result from being overweight. Generally, a person should try to maintain a BMI below 25 kg/m2, but ideally should consult their doctor to determine whether or not they need to make any changes to their lifestyle in order to be healthier.</p>
          
          <h3>Risks associated with being underweight</h3>
          <p>Being underweight has its own associated risks, listed below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, anemia (lowered ability to carry blood vessels)</li>
            <li>Osteoporosis, a disease that causes bone weakness, increasing the risk of breaking a bone</li>
            <li>A decrease in immune function</li>
            <li>Growth and development issues, particularly in children and teenagers</li>
            <li>Potential complications as a result of surgery</li>
            <li>Generally, an increased risk of mortality compared to those with a healthy BMI</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In some cases, being underweight can be a sign of some underlying condition or disease such as anorexia nervosa, which has its own risks. Consult your doctor if you think you or someone you know is underweight, particularly if the reason for being underweight does not seem obvious.</p>
          
          <h3>Limitations of BMI</h3>
          <p>Although BMI is a widely used and useful indicator of healthy body weight, it does have its limitations. BMI is only an estimate that cannot take body composition into account. Due to a wide variety of body types as well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, BMI should be considered along with other measurements rather than being used as the sole method for determining a person's healthy body weight.</p>
          <p><b>In adults:</b></p>
          <p>BMI cannot be fully accurate because it is a measure of excess body weight, rather than excess body fat. BMI is further influenced by factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, muscle mass, body fat, and activity level, among others.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Older adults tend to have more body fat than younger adults with the same BMI.</li>
            <li>Women tend to have more body fat than men for an equivalent BMI.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>In children and adolescents:</b></p>
          <p>The same factors that limit the efficacy of BMI for adults can also apply to children and adolescents. Additionally, height and level of sexual maturation can influence BMI and body fat among children. BMI is a better indicator of excess body fat for obese children than it is for overweight children.</p>
          <p>That being said, BMI is fairly indicative of body fat for 90-95% of the population, and can effectively be used along with other measures to help determine an individual's healthy body weight.</p>
